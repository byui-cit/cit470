# Systems Security II
## Tools: CIT department VPN and OpenShift infrastructure

While enrolled in selected courses,
students manage virtual machines in a private OpenShift infrastructure operated by BYU-Idaho's CSE department.
Our infrastructure consists of clusters of enterprise-grade server hardware,
integrated with Redhat products.

As a CYBER 470 student, you will use OpenShift to create and operate virtual servers.

### Required: Sign into CSE OpenShift ###
*Note: OpenShift runs on a privately addressed server, so it is only available **after** you successfully engage your VPN connection.*

After connecting to the department's VPN service using GlobalProtect, use your BYU-I credentials to log into OpenShift:
