## Task: Above-and-Beyond 9
Complete an optional project that creatively goes "above and beyond" the tasks you and your partner(s) are working on in your team projects.

Students that achieve a passing grade with each of their team tasks and peer evaluations will pass the course with a C grade. Above-and-beyond tasks are projects that students may accomplish individually. There are eight Above-and-beyond opportunities in this course.

This above and beyond option allows you to **create your own task**.

## Proposal and Requirements
- Think of an interesting task which relates to this class.
  - The task should show initiative in taking your cybersecurity learning deeper.
  - Your task needs to be approved by your instructor before you start on it.
- Think of what constitutes success in completing your task. Those conditions are your requirements.
  - You'll show that you meet those requirements by producing your tutorial.
- Write a brief tutorial showing how you completed your task.

## Deliverable
Upload an illustrated tutorial, in which you explain what you did and how you accomplished it.

- Your document should be clear enough that one of your peers would be able to follow your instructions and accomplish the same tasks.
