## Task: (SSL) Remote-Access VPN
Configure a remote-access VPN capability on your Internet-facing firewall that lets members of your team remotely access your team's DMZ hosts.

## Tools
- VPN Gateway

## Requirements
- Configure a SSL Remote Access VPN such that authorized team members can access your team's inside zone hosts from the Internet.
- Show that your outside team member can access your Windows and Linux servers and your tiered app from outside your inside zone.


## Deliverable
Upload an illustrated tutorial, in which you explain what your team did and how you accomplished it.

- Your document should be clear enough that one of your peers would be able to follow your instructions and accomplish the same tasks.
- Identify any difficult or challenging parts of the project, and clearly explain how you diagnosed and overcame your obstacles.
- Include a few cropped screen captures where appropriate. Also upload your updated and annotated network diagram.

## Scoring Rubric
- If your tutorial satisfies every requirement outlined above, you will earn a passing score (one point).
- If your tutorial does not satisfy any one of the above requirements, you will earn no points. Your team must then address any deficiencies and re-upload corrected documents until you earn the passing score.
